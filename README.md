# Gendered Morphology in French and English Occupational Terms

This independent research project compares how gender is morphologically marked in occupational terms across French and English. The study analyzes 40 common professions using authoritative dictionaries and codes each term based on its gender structure (e.g., actor/actress vs. professeur/professeure).

The results reveal a clear contrast:
- **French** retains systematic gender alternations (e.g., *acteur/actrice*, *serveur/serveuse*)
- **English** neutralizes most gendered terms (e.g., *server*, *teacher*)

This reflects broader social trends: **French expands gender visibility**, while **English reduces gender distinction** to pursue inclusivity.
